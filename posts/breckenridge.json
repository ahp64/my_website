    "description": "Coloradoans seem to communicate through their hats. Flat-brim, curved, 5 panel, corduroy, beanie, with or without the little cord running across, even those funny looking ones some cyclists wear. I think I might have seen 5 bare heads of hair in the time I was there and it was like seeing an Orca with dorsal fin collapse. <br> <br> When I try to explain to people how I feel about my car it almost always feels like a futile exercise. I think it embodies my better nature. At one point, way up in the Rockies along I-70, I drove off deep onto an access road to relieve myself and rest for a little. By the time I pulled over, the hum of the interstate had vanished completely. I swear I heard my car gasping for air. <br> <br> Naturally aspirated internal combustion engines lose around 3% of their power for every 1,000 feet of elevation gain. I was at around 10,000 feet at the time, and my 20-year-old, fully loaded, 115hp stick shift Volkswagen Jetta was struggling to make it past 30mph up some of the hills on the highway. <br> <br> A few years ago, when I was gearing up for my first transcontinental drive, my very concerned grandparents offered to straight up gift me their retiree-milage 2019 Golf GTI Autobahn Edition to do the trip with instead. I didn’t even bother explaining to them why when I chose to stick with my 2004 Jetta. The interstate highway system, satellite navigation, climate control, and continuous variable transmission, among other things, have transformed the automobile from a conveyance between oases to an oasis in itself, and have taken much of the romance out of driving.  Still, I sluice a lot of sentimentality out of this car. <br> <br> My Jetta was bought by my dad to get him to work and back. There is no section in the owner’s manual on whether or not to take it dispersed camping in the Rockies, but I think common sense is enough of a counterindication. Unfortunately, at around 9:30PM, on August 16, 2025, at a gas station in Breckenridge, Colorado, I decided to do just that. The dirt road leading into the sites, which were numbered but not well maintained, went on for around a mile before reaching the entrance. Beyond that, the shoulder suddenly gave way to a sheer drop down the side of the mountain and the road narrowed to barely have room for two cars. I started to bounce over potholes that were barely perceptible in the dusk. I was feeling groggy from altitude sickness. Site 1 was taken, along with Site 2. Site 3 went up a steep incline and then behind a thicket of trees. I got out of my car to walk up and see if anyone was there and, sure enough, an old RV's rectangular halogen lights peeked out at me from behind the foliage. I had not taken into account that fact that this was a weekend night, toward the end of the summer, in probably the most outdoorsy state in the country. It was thus that I continued up the mountain, telling myself again and again that the next site would be free as the night grew darker and the potholes grew deeper. Soon, the bottom of the car began to bump, then brush, then painfully scrape across the road. After almost an hour, I reached the end, Site 20, and was dismayed to find yet another tent pitched next to yet another Subaru. <br> <br> I started scraping back down the mountain, defeated, trying in vain to remember by site number which parts of the road the really nasty potholes had been. Finally, I reached the bottom at around 11:00PM. I was right by the gate when I saw, out in the distance, a small, reflective sign that read “0,” one I must have driven by earlier. <br> <br> <i>Gotta be a mile marker.</i> <br> <br> I followed a faint trail into the forest and sure enough, about 30 yards out, I found a clearing with a fire pit. The 0th site. <br> <br> <i> Who the fuck 0-indexes a Forest Service campground. </i> <br> <br> Years of computer science education and I had just committed the cardinal sin of Programming Fundamentals 1. I walked back through the dark, grabbed my tent and sleeping bag from the car, set up camp, and got as comfortable as I could on the gravel. <br> <br> Somehow, the only damage to my car that I found the next morning was a broken splashguard that I was able to zip tie back to the frame 2 days later. Still, I should have stopped at a motel that night. This post is a formal apology to my black 2004 Volkswagen Jetta GL and a promise to do better."
